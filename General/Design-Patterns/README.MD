# Design patterns Creational ,Structural ,Behavioral

* Design patterns are typical solutions to common problems in software design. Each pattern is like a blueprint that you can customize to solve a particular design problem in your code . 
They are formalized best practices that the programmer can use to solve common problems when designing an application or system . There are about 26 Patterns currently discovered and they can be classified into 3 types: Creational, Structural and Behavioral

--------------

1. Creational design patterns are concerned with the way of creating objects. These design patterns are used when a decision must be made at the time of instantiation of a class (i.e. creating an object of a class).

    Hard-Coded code is not the good programming approach. 
    When we are creating the instance by using the new keyword. Sometimes, the nature of the object must be changed according to the nature of the program.
    In such cases, we must get the help of creational design patterns to provide more general and flexible approach.

2. Structural design patterns are concerned with how classes and objects can be composed, to form larger structures.
The structural design patterns simplifies the structure by identifying the relationships.
These patterns focus on, how the classes inherit from each other and how they are composed from other classes.

3. Behavioral Design Patterns are concerned with the interaction and responsibility of objects.

    In these design patterns, the interaction between the objects should be in such a way that they can easily talk to each other and still should be loosely coupled.

    That means the implementation and the client should be loosely coupled in order to avoid hard coding and dependencies.
