# Adpater structural design pattern 

Adapter pattern is used when there is a need to adapt an interface into another according to client expectation.

For instance when you need to pay using dollars to a shop that ONLY receives shekels (NIS) ,  or when you need to connect a graphic card with a DVI interface to a monitor ONLY with a VGA interface.
