5. Events - A Class member that allows to update subscribers about actions that happens inside the class instance .

6. Lambda expressions - Anonymous (with no name) functions

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/operators/lambda-expressions
7. Indexer Methods - Allow instances of a class or struct to be indexed just like arrays. (for exapmles ClassName[0]).

8. Operator overloading - Allows to define an action that operator will apply on a class instance.

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/operators/operator-overloading

9. Custom conversion - Allows to define conversion from one class instance to other class instance.

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/operators/user-defined-conversion-operators

10. Extention methods - Methods that extends existing classes functionality , and are accessible threw the extended class instance.

11. Garbage collection - (GC) serves as an automatic memory manager. The garbage collector manages the allocation and release of memory for an application.

12. Lazy instantiation - Creation is deferred until it is first used.

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/performance/lazy-initialization

13. Assemblies,Libraries - Assemblies form the fundamental units of deployment , An assembly is a collection of types and resources that are built to work together and form a logical unit of functionality. Assemblies take the form of executable (.exe) or dynamic link library (.dll) files

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/assembly/

14. Reflection, Attributes - Prodvide meta data to describe assemblies, modules, and types.

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/reflection

15. Hashing - A hash is a fixed-size string of characters that is generated by a mathematical function called a hash function. The hash function takes an input (or ‘message’) and returns a fixed-size string of bytes. The output of the hash function is typically a hexadecimal string that represents the input data.

Hash functions are commonly used in cryptography to ensure the integrity of data. For example, when storing passwords, instead of storing the password itself, the hash of the password is stored. When a user enters their password, the hash of the entered password is compared to the stored hash to determine if it is correct.

Hash functions have the property that it is computationally infeasible to generate the same hash output from two different input values (also called the collision resistance property). This means that if two different inputs have the same hash value, it is highly likely that the inputs are identical.
